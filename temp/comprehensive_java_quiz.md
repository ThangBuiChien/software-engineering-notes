## Comprehensive Scenario Questions:

### 63. **Design Question (Hard):**

"You need to design a system that manages employees in a company. Each employee has basic info (name, id, salary) but there are different types: Manager, Developer, Intern. Managers have teams, Developers have skills, Interns have mentors. How would you design this using OOP principles? Include considerations for data access, collections usage, and exception handling."

### 64. **Performance Question (Hard):**

"Your application is experiencing memory issues. You notice that you're using lots of Strings, Collections, and creating many temporary objects. How would you identify and fix performance bottlenecks? Consider String handling, Collection choices, object creation patterns, and garbage collection."

### 65. **Integration Question (Hard):**

"You have a legacy system that uses Collections to store data, but now you need to add filtering, transformation, and parallel processing capabilities. How would you integrate Java 8+ features while maintaining backward compatibility? Consider Stream API, lambda expressions, and method references."

## Interview Tips:

### **Technical Communication:**

- Always explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Use concrete examples from real projects
- Draw diagrams if helpful (especially for OOP relationships)
- Connect concepts ("This relates to what we discussed about...")

### **Code Examples:**

- Keep them simple but complete
- Explain your thinking process
- Consider edge cases
- Mention potential improvements

### **Depth vs Breadth:**

- Start with high-level overview
- Dive deeper based on interviewer's interest
- Be ready to explain underlying mechanisms
- Connect to real-world scenarios

**Good luck with your interview! ðŸš€**
