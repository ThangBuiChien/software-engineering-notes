## Quick Answer Tips for Each Section:

### **Spring Basics:**
- Always mention "loose coupling" and "easier testing" as DI benefits
- Know that ApplicationContext is the main Spring container

### **Dependency Injection:**
- Prefer constructor injection, explain why (immutability, required dependencies)
- @Qualifier solves multiple bean conflicts

### **Bean Scopes:**
- Singleton = one instance per container (default)
- Prototype = new instance every time requested

### **Lifecycle:**
- @PostConstruct = after dependency injection
- @PreDestroy = before bean destruction

### **AOP:**
- Cross-cutting concerns like logging, security
- Don't go too deep - awareness level is fine

### **Practical Questions:**
- Always think about real project examples
- Show understanding of layered architecture (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository)

## Interview Day Strategy:

1. **Start simple** - Give basic answer first, then elaborate if asked
2. **Use examples** - Reference your actual project experience
3. **Be honest** - If you don't know something, say so but show willingness to learn
4. **Ask questions** - Show interest in their Spring usage

**Remember:** For junior level, they want to see you understand the concepts and can work with them, not that you're a Spring expert! ðŸš€
