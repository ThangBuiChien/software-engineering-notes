# B-trees and B+ trees Notes

## Basic Concepts

### B-tree

- Self-balancing tree data structure
- Keeps data sorted
- All leaf nodes must be at the same level
- Each node can have multiple keys and children
- Property: If a node has n keys, it has n+1 children

### B+ tree

- Variant of B-tree
- Optimized for disk operations and databases
- All data stored in leaf nodes
- Leaf nodes are linked together
- Internal nodes only store keys for navigation

## Key Differences

| Feature         | B-tree                   | B+ tree                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Data Storage    | All nodes                | Only leaf nodes                                 |
| Leaf Connection | No connection            | Linked list                                     |
| Key Duplication | No duplicates            | Keys can appear in both internal and leaf nodes |
| Search Path     | Can end at any level     | Always goes to leaf level                       |
| Space Usage     | Less space for same data | More space due to key duplication               |
| Range Queries   | Requires tree traversal  | Efficient using leaf links                      |

## Why B+ trees in Databases?

1. Disk I/O Optimization

   - Higher fanout (more keys per node)
   - Fewer disk reads needed
   - Better block utilization

2. Query Performance

   - Predictable search time (always to leaf)
   - Efficient range queries
   - Good for sequential access

3. Practical Benefits
   - Better cache utilization
   - Simpler concurrent access
   - Easier locking mechanisms

## Common Operations

### Search Operation

1. Start at root
2. Use keys to navigate down
3. Must reach leaf node even if key found in internal node
4. Return data if found in leaf

### Range Query

1. Search for lower bound
2. Follow leaf node links
3. Collect all values until upper bound
4. No need to traverse tree multiple times

## Real-world Applications

1. Database Management Systems

   - MySQL (InnoDB)
   - PostgreSQL
   - Oracle

2. File Systems
   - NTFS
   - ext4

## Performance Characteristics

### B+ tree

- Search: O(log n)
- Insert: O(log n)
- Delete: O(log n)
- Space: O(n)
- Sequential Access: O(1) per record

### Advantages

1. Consistent query performance
2. Excellent for range queries
3. Good for sequential scanning
4. Efficient for large datasets

### Limitations

1. Extra space for duplicate keys
2. Slightly more complex implementation
3. All modifications require reaching leaf level

## Best Practices

1. Choose Appropriate Node Size

   - Based on disk block size
   - Optimize for memory/disk transfer

2. Consider Use Case

   - B-tree: When memory is limited
   - B+ tree: When range queries are common

3. Implementation Considerations
   - Cache frequently accessed nodes
   - Optimize node split/merge operations
   - Consider bulk loading for large datasets

## Historical Note

- Developed by Rudolf Bayer and Edward M. McCreight in 1970
- Originally at Boeing Research Labs
- B+ tree evolved as optimization for databases
- Still relevant after 50+ years

## Remember

- All searches in B+ tree MUST reach leaf level
- Internal nodes are just for navigation
- Linked leaf nodes are key feature for range queries
- Database indexes primarily use B+ trees
