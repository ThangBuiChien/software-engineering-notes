## What is Machine Learning?

## 1.Types of Machine Learning

### 1.1 What is ML

### 1.2 Types of ML

- supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement.

#### 1.2.1 Supervised Learning

- In supervised learning, the dataset is the collection of labeled examples
  $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$
- Each element $x_i$ among N i is called **feature vector**. A feature vector is a vector where each dimension $j = 1,...,D$ contains a value called a feature, denoted as $x^{(j)}$. For example, $x^{(1)}$ could be height, $x^{(2)}$ could be weight, and so on.
- $y_i$ is a label which is the value we want to predict based on the feature vector $x_i$.

- The goal is use data set to product **model** that take input a feature vector $x$ and output a prediction label for this feature vector

### 1.3 How Supervised Learning Works

In summary, supervised learning involves:

1. Gathering labeled data.
2. Converting data into feature vectors.
3. Using a learning algorithm to create a model.
4. Using the model to make predictions.
