## **🗓️ 21-Day Design Pattern Learning Plan**

### **Week 1: Creational Patterns (Object Creation)**

1️⃣ **Singleton** – Managing a single instance  
2️⃣ **Factory Method** – Creating objects flexibly  
3️⃣ **Abstract Factory** – Handling related object families  
4️⃣ **Builder** – Constructing complex objects step-by-step  
5️⃣ **Prototype** – Cloning instead of creating new instances  
6️⃣ **Review Day** – Implementing 2+ creational patterns in a mini-project  
7️⃣ **Quiz & Application** – Spot and apply these patterns in real-world projects

### **Week 2: Structural Patterns (Object Composition)**

8️⃣ **Adapter** – Converting one interface to another  
9️⃣ **Decorator** – Adding behavior dynamically  
🔟 **Proxy** – Controlling access to objects  
1️⃣1️⃣ **Facade** – Simplifying complex systems  
1️⃣2️⃣ **Composite** – Managing tree structures like menus or files  
1️⃣3️⃣ **Review Day** – Implementing 2+ structural patterns in a mini-project  
1️⃣4️⃣ **Quiz & Application** – Identify structural patterns in frameworks

### **Week 3: Behavioral Patterns (Object Interaction)**

1️⃣5️⃣ **Strategy** – Swapping algorithms at runtime  
1️⃣6️⃣ **Observer** – Implementing event-driven behavior  
1️⃣7️⃣ **Command** – Encapsulating actions as objects  
1️⃣8️⃣ **Template Method** – Defining steps but allowing flexibility  
1️⃣9️⃣ **Chain of Responsibility** – Passing requests along a chain  
2️⃣0️⃣ **Review Day** – Implementing 2+ behavioral patterns in a mini-project  
2️⃣1️⃣ **Final Project & Self-Test** – Apply multiple patterns in a project

## **✅ Daily Learning Checklist**

For each pattern, go through:

1. **🧠 Understand**

   - What problem does it solve?
   - When should you use it?
   - Real-world examples

2. **📝 Implement Basic Code**

   - Write a simple Java example
   - Identify key components (e.g., interface, implementation)

3. **⚡ Apply in Real-World Context**

   - Where is this used in Java/Spring?
   - How does this compare to similar patterns?

4. **🛠️ Mini-Project or Refactoring**

   - Modify an old project or create a small demo using the pattern

5. **🎯 Self-Test**
   - Can you explain the pattern without notes?
   - Can you implement it from scratch?
   - Can you refactor existing code using it?
