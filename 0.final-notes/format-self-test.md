# General Self-Assessment Questions for Any Java Topic

## 1. Conceptual Understanding

- What problem does this concept solve?
- How does it work internally?
- What are the key characteristics of this concept?
- How does it compare to similar concepts (e.g., `ArrayList` vs `LinkedList`)?
- What are the real-world use cases for this concept?

## 2. Explanation & Teaching

- Can I explain this to a beginner in simple words?
- Can I draw a diagram to visualize the concept?
- Can I write a concise definition in 2-3 sentences?
- Can I give a real-world analogy that makes sense?

## 3. Code Implementation

- Can I write a working code example without looking it up?
- Can I explain the logic behind my code?
- Can I write different variations of the implementation?
- Can I debug and fix common errors related to this topic?

## 4. Practical Application

- Where have I used this concept in real projects?
- Can I apply this in a different or unexpected scenario?
- What are the best practices for using this concept effectively?
- What are the performance trade-offs when using this?

## 5. Edge Cases & Deep Thinking

- What happens if I remove or modify part of my implementation?
- What are the common pitfalls or mistakes?
- How does this concept behave in extreme cases (e.g., very large data, multiple threads)?
- Can I optimize this for better performance or readability?

# Applying This to Specific Java Topics

## Example 1: OOP - Polymorphism

✅ **Concept:** What is polymorphism, and why is it useful?

✅ **Explanation:** How would you explain it to a beginner?

✅ **Code:** Can you write an example with method overriding?

✅ **Application:** Where have you seen polymorphism used in real projects?

✅ **Edge Case:** What happens if we remove `@Override` in method overriding?

## Example 2: Java Collections - HashMap

✅ **Concept:** How does `HashMap` store key-value pairs internally?

✅ **Explanation:** What is hashing, and why does it improve performance?

✅ **Code:** Can you implement a simple `HashMap` usage?

✅ **Application:** When should we use `HashMap` vs `TreeMap`?

✅ **Edge Case:** What happens when two keys have the **same hashcode**?

## Example 3: Exception Handling - try-catch-finally

✅ **Concept:** What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?

✅ **Explanation:** Why do we need exception handling in Java?

✅ **Code:** Can you write a method that throws a custom exception?

✅ **Application:** When is it better to **handle** vs **propagate** exceptions?

✅ **Edge Case:** What happens if `finally` contains a `return` statement?

# How to Use These Questions Effectively?

✅ **Write answers in your own words** (avoid memorizing).

✅ **Test yourself by explaining concepts out loud** as if teaching a junior dev.

✅ **Implement small projects** that apply multiple concepts together.

✅ **Challenge yourself with tricky edge cases and optimizations.**
