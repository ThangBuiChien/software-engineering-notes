## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- Take personal experiment and experience as an example
- It does not mean that class should have only one method, but it should have only one reason to change.
- Example: Layered Architecture (Controller, Service, Repository, etc), what method should add to class in entity ??

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Example: In method payment, If we use if else for each payment method, then we need to modify the method each time we add a new payment method. Instead, we can use a strategy pattern to make the method open for extension.
  => Strategy Pattern: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- A subclass should be able to replace its superclass without breaking the system and No class should be forced to implement methods it does not use

- Ex3: Animals supper class, have method eat(), breath(), etc. If Robot Dog extends Animal, it should not have eat() method, but it should have charge() method => It not make sense to replace => It should never happend
- Ex4: Interface Segregation Principle: A class should not be forced to implement methods it does not use. If we have a class that implements an interface, but it does not use all the methods of the interface, then we should split the interface into smaller interfaces.

=> Same idea that: A class should only do what makes sense for it

### 5. Dependence Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- It mean we should not tightly couple classes together, but instead, we should loosely couple them by using interfaces.

- EX: IOC, DI, etc
- Ex: OrderService depends on PaymentProcessor interface, allowing multiple payment implementations (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment).
