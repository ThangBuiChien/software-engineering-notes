# README

For junior developers (0-1 years of experience), focus on sections 1-5 which establish a solid foundation in Java syntax, object-oriented programming principles, exception handling, collections, and generics

For developers transitioning to mid-level positions (1-2 years of experience), sections 6-12 cover more advanced concepts including modern Java features (Java 8+), multithreading, design patterns, and professional development practices like testing and build tools

# Essential Java Knowledge Map

## 1. Java Fundamentals (Foundation)

- **Basic Syntax and Data Types**

  - Primitive types (int, boolean, char, etc.)
  - Reference types
  - Type conversion and casting
  - Variable declarations and initialization
  - Constants (final keyword)

- **Operators and Expressions**

  - Arithmetic, relational, logical operators
  - Operator precedence
  - Assignment operators and compound assignments

- **Control Flow**

  - Conditionals (if-else, switch-case)
  - Loops (for, enhanced for, while, do-while)
  - Break, continue, return statements

- **Methods and Functions**

  - Method declarations and signatures
  - Return types and parameters
  - Method overloading
  - Varargs (... syntax)
  - Static vs instance methods

- **Access Control**
  - Public, private, protected, default access modifiers
  - Scope and visibility

## 2. Object-Oriented Programming (Core Strength)

- **OOP Principles**

  - Encapsulation (data hiding, getters/setters)
  - Inheritance (extends keyword, IS-A relationship)
  - Polymorphism (method overriding, runtime binding)
  - Abstraction (abstract classes, interfaces)

- **Classes and Objects**

  - Class structure and design
  - Object creation and lifecycle
  - Constructors (including chaining with this() and super())
  - The 'this' and 'super' keywords

- **Inheritance Hierarchy**

  - Object class and its methods
  - Method overriding (@Override annotation)
  - Constructor chaining in inheritance

- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**
  - Abstract methods and classes
  - Interface definition and implementation
  - Default and static methods in interfaces (Java 8+)
  - Functional interfaces and their importance
  - Multiple inheritance with interfaces

## 3. Exception Handling

- **Exception Hierarchy**

  - Throwable, Exception, RuntimeException
  - Checked vs unchecked exceptions

- **Exception Handling Mechanisms**

  - try-catch-finally blocks
  - try-with-resources (Java 7+)
  - Multi-catch blocks
  - throw vs throws keywords

- **Custom Exceptions**

  - Creating custom exception classes
  - When to use checked vs unchecked exceptions

- **Best Practices**
  - Exception handling strategies
  - Logging exceptions properly
  - Avoiding anti-patterns

## 4. Collections Framework

- **Collection Interfaces**

  - Collection, List, Set, Map, Queue
  - Understanding collection hierarchy

- **Implementation Classes**

  - ArrayList, LinkedList (when to use which)
  - HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
  - HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap
  - PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque

- **Collection Operations**

  - Adding, removing, searching elements
  - Iterating collections (for-each, iterators)
  - Sorting (Comparable, Comparator)
  - Utility methods (Collections class)

- **Special Collections**
  - Immutable collections (List.of(), Set.of(), Map.of())
  - Thread-safe collections
  - Legacy collections (Vector, Hashtable)

## 5. Generics (For Type Safety)

- **Generic Classes and Methods**
  - Type parameters and wildcards
  - Generic collections
  - Type erasure concept
  - Bounded type parameters
  - PECS principle (Producer Extends, Consumer Super)

## 6. Java 8+ Modern Features (Career Advancement)

- **Functional Programming**

  - Lambda expressions syntax and usage
  - Method references (::)
  - Functional interfaces (Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier)

- **Stream API**

  - Creating streams
  - Intermediate operations (filter, map, flatMap)
  - Terminal operations (collect, reduce, forEach)
  - Common collectors (toList, toSet, groupingBy)
  - Parallel streams

- **Optional Class**

  - Handling null values properly
  - Optional operations (map, flatMap, orElse)
  - Best practices with Optional

- **Date and Time API**
  - LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime
  - ZonedDateTime and time zones
  - Period and Duration
  - Date formatting and parsing

## 7. Java Language Enhancements

- **Java 9-17 Features**
  - Modules (Java 9)
  - var keyword for local variables (Java 10)
  - Switch expressions (Java 12+)
  - Text blocks (Java 15)
  - Records (Java 16)
  - Pattern matching (Java 16+)
  - Sealed classes (Java 17)
