- Java Fundamentals

  - Basic syntax and data types
  - Variables and constants (final keyword)
  - Operators and expressions
  - Control flow statements (if-else, switch-case, loops)
  - Access modifiers
  - Primitive vs reference types
  - Static and instance variables, static methods
  - Wrapper classes
  - Type casting
  - Varargs(... syntax)

- OOP concepts

  - four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
  - Class, Object, and Constructor (including chaining)
  - The this and super keyword
  - Method overloading and overriding
  - Abstract class and Interface
  - Default and static methods in interface (with default and static methods)
  - Object cloning (clone() method and cloneable interface)

- Collections and generics

  - Overview of List, Set, Map interfaces and their implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap)
  - When to use each collection type
  - Some most common methods of List, Set, Map interface
  - More advanced collection such as queue, stack, priority queue, vector
  - Iterator and ListIterator
  - Comparable and Comparator interfaces (compareTo() and compare() methods)
  - Unmodifiable & Read-Only Collections (Collections.unmodifiableXXX()) (List.of(), Set.of(), Map.of())
  - Concurrent Collections
  - Generics

- Exceptional handling

  - checked and unchecked exceptions
  - throw vs throws
  - try-catch-finally
  - try-with-resources (Java 7+)
  - custom exceptions (extends Exception or RuntimeException)
  - best practices

- Multithreading (Currently it not necessary for fresher)

- Important concepts

  - String handling

    - String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer
    - String immutability and String pool

  - Memory management

    - stack vs heap
    - Object creation and memory allocation

  - Garbage collection

    - Reference types (Strong, Weak, Soft, Phantom)
    - finalize() method

  - Equality and Comparison

    - == vs equals
    - hashcode and equals method

  - final, finally, finalize

  - Pass-by-Value vs. Pass-by-Reference in Java

- Java 8+ features

  - Lambda expressions

    - functional interfaces
    - single abstract method interfaces
    - lambda syntax and method references

  - Stream API

    - Intermediate operations and terminal operations
    - Reduction techniques
    - Collectors
    - Parallel streams

  - Optional class

  - Date and Time API

  - var keyword (java 10+)

  - record (java 14+)
